# Supernova event classification

This is a preliminary study to classify different types of supernova event interactions in the DUNE Far Detector.

The dataset will be generated with LArSoft, and then transformed into HDF5 images. The models used for the study will come from 2 sources:
1. Using existing large image classification models through transfer learning
2. Building small convolutional neural network
